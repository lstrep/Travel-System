# travelSystem
simple travel system made during my studies at PJATK

First part of the project consisted of creating its documentation which is available in the Documentation.pdf file.
It contains:
- User requirements,
- Use Case Diagram,
- Analytical Class Diagram,
- Implementation Class Diagram,
- Use case scenario,
- Activity Diagram for given Use Case
- State diagram for a class,
- Sequence diagram,
- GUI project,

In the implementation of the project I used;
- Java, 
- Hibernate and H2 database to preserve all the data on the localhost, 
- Swing to create GUI for two use cases which are; creating trips and saving them to the database, making a booking.


Some screenshots presenting layout of the application:

During this project I focused on understanding Hibernate framework. I've created database to which every operation was saved. 
All the details can be retrieved from the system after termination of its work and rebooting.
